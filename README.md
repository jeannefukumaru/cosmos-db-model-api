How to use Cosmos DB for low-latency access to features during model inference 
Databricks recently  announced support for Cosmos DB as an online feature store. This announcement comes in addition to existing support for other online databases such as Dynamo DB and Azure MySQL. Support for more online databases are planned. 

In conjunction with this announcement, we wanted to highlight how users can get started using Databricks Feature Store with Cosmos DB. Online databases are increasingly prevalent as more applications move towards serving machine learning predictions at scale and with low-latency. However, not many users are familiar with concepts such as the differences between online and offline features, and when to use one over the other. Therefore, in this article, we cover both an end-to-end example of how to use Cosmos DB with Databricks Feature Store, as well as introduce the reader to what online stores are and how they fit into a machine learning modelâ€™s lifecycle.
